# Dynasty Scans Dark Theme
Simple dark Dynasty Reader UserCSS style, feel free to issue or ask me anything.

### Installation:
To use this you need the Stylus extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/styl-us/) or [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/es/extensions/details/stylus/), click the badge below, accept the instalation on the left side of the tab it will open and you're good to go.
There's just a couple of lines so if you want to edit any color locally, it should be pretty navigable.

### Version: 0.4.0
There's some things left to improve:
- Adding variables for easier editing somewhere in the future...?

I should note that it was tested only on the vanilla site (issue any bugs you encounter!), I have yet to try any user scripts since I personally don't use any; aside from that, everything else's pretty much done, hope you like it.
